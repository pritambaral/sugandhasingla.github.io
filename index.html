    <h3>Resiliency Considerations in Biofuels Production Supply Chain Network Optimisation<right>July-Present 2014</right></h3>
    <h5>
      Guide: Prof Yogendra Shastri, IIT Bombay
    </h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Developed a Deterministic Optimization Model using Mixed Integer Linear Programming in GAMS which provides optimal supply chain network design for  
	lignocellulosic biofuels produced in 13 County region of Southern Illinois, USA.</li> 
	<li>Incorporated the theoretical concept of Regional Biomass Processing Depots (RBPDs) to quantitatively analyse and show their importance in reducing transport 
	costs, acting as efficient storage locations and in turn, mitigating losses incurred due to disruptions in network such as loss of feed due to calamities like floods, drought etc.</li>
    <li>Developed a Stochastic Optimization Model to incorporate disruptions costs accounting for uncertainties in network by adding probable eventualities of the uncertainties in the model.
	The model provides the Optimized Supply Chain Design with quantized efficiency-resiliency trade-offs. Ananlysis shows substantial improvements in reliability can be made with marginal rise 
	in operating cost without decreasing efficiency very much.</li>
	<li>I am currently writing a research paper - 'Resiliency Considerations in Biofuel Supply Chain Network Design Optimisation' based on the research project.</li>
